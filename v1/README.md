# HPML-Project

High Performance Machine Learning Course
Project Proposal: Automated Multi-GPU Training and Deployment Framework for PyTorch. Ideally, there should be a solution that is compatible with dockers and kubernetes.

## 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to develop an automated framework for multi-GPU training and deployment in PyTorch, addressing critical challenges in memory management and weight allocation across multiple GPUs. The proposed solution will simplify the process of distributed training, optimize resource utilization, and improve overall performance for machine learning practitioners.

## 2. [Problem Statement](./problems.md)

As machine learning models grow in complexity, training and deploying them on a single GPU often leads to out-of-memory errors and extended training times. While multi-GPU solutions exist, they typically require manual optimization and complex setup processes. The main challenges include:

1. Memory management issues leading to out-of-memory errors
2. Complexity in setting up distributed training environments
3. Inefficient load balancing across multiple GPUs
4. Communication overhead in distributed settings
5. Need for manual optimization of memory and weight allocations

## 3. [Proposed Solution](./Solutions.md)

We propose to develop an automated framework that addresses these challenges by:

1. Automating the distribution of model components and data across available GPUs
2. Implementing dynamic memory management that adapts to model architecture and available resources
3. Developing algorithms for efficient load balancing across GPUs
4. Optimizing inter-GPU communication protocols
5. Creating a user-friendly API that abstracts the complexities of distributed training

## 4. Methodology

The project will be executed in the following phases:

1. **Analysis**: Thoroughly examine existing multi-GPU solutions and their limitations
2. **Design**: Architect the automated framework, focusing on modularity and extensibility
3. **Implementation**: Develop core components including:
   - Automated model partitioning
   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - Load balancing algorithms

4. **Testing and Benchmarking**: Rigorously test the framework on various model architectures and datasets
5. **Optimization**: Iteratively refine the framework based on benchmark results and user feedback
6. **Documentation and Deployment**: Create comprehensive documentation and deploy as an open-source PyTorch extension

## 5. Technical Approach

The framework will build upon existing PyTorch functionalities and incorporate state-of-the-art techniques:

1. **DistributedDataParallel (DDP)**: Leverage DDP's efficient process-based approach for multi-GPU training
2. **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**: Implement AMP to reduce memory usage and speed up training
3. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Incorporate gradient checkpointing to optimize memory usage for large models
4. **ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)**: Adapt ZeRO techniques to reduce memory redundancy across GPUs
5. **Dynamic Memory Management**: Develop advanced memory management algorithms that adapt to real-time resource availability

## 6. Expected Outcomes

1. A user-friendly, automated multi-GPU training and deployment framework for PyTorch
2. Significant reduction in out-of-memory errors during multi-GPU training
3. Improved training speeds and resource utilization compared to manual multi-GPU setups
4. Comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate adoption by the ML community

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

The project's success will be evaluated based on:

1. Reduction in out-of-memory errors compared to baseline PyTorch implementations
2. Training speed improvements across various model architectures and datasets
3. Memory utilization efficiency across multiple GPUs
4. Ease of use, measured through user studies and community feedback
