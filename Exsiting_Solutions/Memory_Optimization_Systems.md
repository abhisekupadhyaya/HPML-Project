# Review of Memory Optimization Systems for AI/ML

## 1. ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer)

Developed by Microsoft as part of DeepSpeed, ZeRO is a powerful memory optimization technique that enables training of extremely large models with billions of parameters.

**Key features:**
- Partitions optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across GPUs
- Implements three progressive stages (ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, ZeRO-3) with increasing memory efficiency
- Supports offloading to CPU and NVMe storage
- Enables training models with over 100 billion parameters

**Advantages:**
- Dramatically reduces per-GPU memory footprint
- Maintains model parallelism benefits without code changes
- Scales efficiently to large distributed systems

## 2. Gradient Checkpointing

A widely adopted technique available in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

**Key features:**
- Trades computation for memory by selectively recomputing activations during backpropagation
- Allows fine-grained control over which layers to checkpoint

**Advantages:**
- Significant memory savings with minimal performance impact
- Easy to implement in existing models

## 3. Activation Offloading

Implemented in systems like DeepSpeed and Hugging Face Accelerate.

**Key features:**
- Offloads activation tensors to CPU memory during the forward pass
- Brings activations back to GPU only when needed for backpropagation

**Advantages:**
- Reduces GPU memory usage without affecting model architecture
- Works well in conjunction with other optimization techniques

## 4. Mixed Precision Training

Supported by NVIDIA's Apex library and natively in frameworks like PyTorch.

**Key features:**
- Uses lower precision (e.g., FP16) for most operations
- Maintains a master copy of weights in FP32 for numeric stability

**Advantages:**
- Reduces memory usage and increases computational throughput
- Minimal accuracy impact when implemented correctly

## 5. Memory-Efficient Optimizers

Various implementations exist, including those in DeepSpeed and Fairscale.

**Key features:**
- Optimizers like Adam with 8-bit state compression
- Fused optimizer implementations that reduce memory allocations

**Advantages:**
- Reduces optimizer state memory footprint
- Can be combined with other techniques for cumulative benefits

## 6. Dynamic Memory Management

Implemented in systems like PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).

**Key features:**
- Dynamically allocates and frees memory during training
- Uses memory pooling to reduce fragmentation

**Advantages:**
- Optimizes memory usage based on actual runtime requirements
- Reduces overall memory footprint without manual intervention

## 7. Model Sharding

Utilized in frameworks like Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed.

**Key features:**
- Splits large models across multiple GPUs
- Implements efficient inter-GPU communication for forward and backward passes

**Advantages:**
- Enables training of models larger than single GPU memory
- Scales to massive model sizes (trillions of parameters)
